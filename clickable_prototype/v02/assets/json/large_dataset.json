We'll break down this 'energy' concept even further.\n\nRemember when you've used a great application with high UX and it almost felt effortless? Remember other application you've used and you hated them because it was energy draining?\n\nGood UX = effortless or essentially, minimum energy needed to accomplish desired tasks Bad UX = draining, or essentially, high energy needed to accomplish desired tasks\n\nDefining UX this way will be important and will be key in how you focus on improving your UX skills.\n\nDesigning an application or any product with a high user satsifaction is what the goal of UX is. In this course, you'll learn some of the fundamentals of what makes a great user experience. It's also important to know what UX is not as a lot of people often get used between UX and design.</p>",

In fact, imagine this was an important travel route for many people, where thousands of people each day traveled from point A to point B and point B back to point A. We'll say that the energy consumption for solving this need this way consumes energy of 100kJ.</p><p>Imagine that when there has been a new route discovered and that now people can go from point A to point B with 20% less energy! This form of energy could be 20% less in terms of energy needed to stay awake and alert, or could even save 20% of the time (where we would argue that wasting time is also a form of energy as no one likes to waste time and wasting time is energy draining!). Do you think people would all move immediately to this new enhanced UX solution? Maybe not immediately, but eventually, once people have all been exposed to this better UX solution, they will most likely switch over.</p><p>Imagine that there is a breakthrough and someone created a new transportation device (e.g., a car) where it now takes 10X less energy to go from point A to point B. When that happens, it's a whole new industry where the old industry is now disrupted. Designing a solution with 10X improvement (over the competitors or over an existing solution) creates a whole new era for that industry, and this is exactly what Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other major software firms have done.</p><p>You may be able to create a 10X UX improvement. If you do, you should talk to me so that we can work on that together. However, even if you were to create a 20-40%+ UX improvement in helping people achieve their desired tasks, you can build a healthy business.</p>",

It can lead to confusion, frustration, and ultimately, a lack of engagement or abandonment of the product. Common issues that contribute to bad UX include poor navigation, lack of consistency, overwhelming amount of information, and not understanding the user's needs or goals. To improve UX, it's important to conduct user research and testing, and to have a clear understanding of the user's needs and goals. Additionally, using clear and consistent design principles, and keeping the user's needs at the forefront can help to create a positive experience.\n\nBad UX can manifest in a variety of ways, but some common examples include:</p><ul><li><p>Confusing navigation: If a user cannot easily find what they are looking for, they may become frustrated and give up on the product. Navigation should be clear and intuitive, with a consistent layout and clear labels for buttons and links.</p></li><li><p>Lack of consistency: Inconsistencies in design and functionality can create confusion for the user. Consistency helps the user build a mental model of how the product works, which makes it easier for them to use.</p></li><li><p>Overwhelming amount of information: Presenting too much information at once can be overwhelming and make it difficult for the user to find what they need. It's important to prioritize the most important information and present it in a clear and organized way.</p></li><li><p>Not understanding user needs: It's crucial to understand the user's needs and goals in order to design a product that meets their needs. Without this understanding, the product may fail to meet the user's expectations, resulting in a poor experience.</p></li><li><p>Lack of feedback: Providing feedback to the user can help them understand what is happening and what they need to do. For example, when a button is clicked, the user should be provided with feedback, such as a message or visual indication that their action has been successful.</p></li><li><p>No clear Call to Action: A clear call to action (CTA) is a key element of user interface that tells the user what to do next. Without a clear CTA, the user may not know how to proceed, or they may become frustrated trying to find the next step.</p></li><li><p>No mobile optimization: With the increasing use of mobile devices, it is important to ensure that your website or application is optimized for smaller screens and touch-based interactions. A product that is not optimized for mobile may be difficult to use and could lead to a poor user experience.</p></li></ul><p>These are just a few examples, but the bottom line is that bad UX can significantly harm the user's experience and discourage them from using the product. To prevent this, it is important to conduct user research and testing, to have a clear understanding of the user's needs and goals, and to use clear and consistent design principles that prioritize the user's needs.</p>"

For example, the rise of mobile devices has led to a greater emphasis on designing for smaller screens and touch-based interactions. Additionally, the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has led to the development of new interaction models, such as conversational interfaces.Another observation is that UX is a multidisciplinary field that draws on a variety of disciplines including psychology, sociology, and computer science. It involves understanding user needs and behavior, as well as the technical capabilities of the product or service.Lastly, good UX is not only about making a product look good, but also about making it easy and efficient to use and meet the user's goals and needs.

It's okay to include nice-to-have features, but as soon as you get confused about which are must-haves vs. nice have, you're off to a bad start.</li><li>Use font size, color, or contrast ratio to make the must-to-have features stand out more than the nice-to-have features.</li><li>Use proven layouts to make information flow naturally. Avoid creating your own custom layout that the users are not used to seeing. Stick with the best practices layout that's appropriate for your application size (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet).</li><li>Use appropriate messaging to address the user's needs or to guide the users. For example, adding a one-sentence or a short description about what the key feature is and explaining that in a text to the user can be helpful. Especially as new users are navigating through your application.</li></ol><p>As you get into UX, you'll hear people saying, 'Don't make me think!'. Using your application should be almost effortless and intuitive. You do this by knowing what are must to have features and also by better understanding your user base. Do all the thinking so that your users won’t have to.</p>",
