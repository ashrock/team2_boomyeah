They named their company 'Village88' and began by offering custom software development services to small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nAs the company gained more clients, they realized the potential of their technology and began to develop their own software products. In 2012, Village88 launched its first product, a cloud-based project management tool that quickly became popular among small businesses and freelancers.\n\nBy 2013, Village88 had attracted the attention of venture capitalists and secured a significant round of funding. With this funding, they were able to hire a larger team of engineers and expand their product line to include a range of business management software.\n\nIn 2015, Village88 made its first acquisition, a small startup that specialized in developing mobile apps. This move helped Village88 to expand their capabilities and offer a complete software suite to their customers.\n\nAs the company continued to grow, they began to focus on expanding their market reach. In 2017, Village88 opened an office in the United States, which helped them to gain a foothold in the American market. By 2018, Village88 had offices in several countries, and their software was being used by thousands of businesses worldwide.\n\nToday, Village88 is a leading provider of software solutions for businesses of all sizes. They continue to innovate and develop new products to meet the ever-changing needs of their customers. The company has also been recognized for its commitment to sustainability, and has been named one of the fastest-growing tech companies in the industry.</p>",

I really enjoyed attending the course and learned a lot during it. All of the material was presented very clearly and it was very easy to understand all of the information that was covered. At the end of the course, I was able to create a fully functional website on my own using the skills that I had learned during the class. I would recommend this bootcamp to anyone interested in learning how to develop websites. It was a great experience and I learned a lot from it.",
